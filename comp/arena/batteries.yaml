summary: Have a supply of charged batteries by the $SRYYYY Arenas

priority: major

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We should have a supply of charged batteries by the entrance to the arena
  so that teams don't need to go to helpdesk on the way to the arena to
  get one. This will also ensure that robots perform to their best since
  we can just given them new batteries if there's any uncertainty.
