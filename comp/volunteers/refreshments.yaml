summary: Plan refreshments for volunteers

priority: critical

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We should have some refreshments for the volunteers at the competition.
  At a minimum this will include water and cups being available at all times
  throughout the competition including the setup day.

  This should include at least tea, coffee & water as well as some biscuits &
  fruit.

  We will also need a volunteer to take these refreshments to the volunteers who
  are staffing stationary posts, especially those who are permanently in a
  single role and cannot get refreshments for themselves.
